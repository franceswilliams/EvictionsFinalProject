### **Project Title:** Demographic and housing correlates of evictions in NYC, 2000-2016

### **Project Overview:**

**Group members:** Frances Williams (fw2334), Gloria Hu (gh2518), Naama Kipperman (nk2814), Will Simmons (wes2121)

**Motivation for this project:** Evictions represent a major source of housing instability. We are interested in census tract- and neighborhood-level factors affecting the rates of eviction and eviction filings in NYC. 

**Intended final products:** A website providing an overview of eviction metrics by census tracts, as well as interactive maps illustrating the relationship between neighborhood-level variables and eviction rates. 


### **Anticipated Data Sources:**

* Primary source: [Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/) 

* For gentrification measures: [New York Gentrification Data](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/new-york-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html)

* For dissimilarity indices, English language usage, population change: [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/guided_search.xhtml)

* Supplemental data source: [NYC Open Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nynta.page)




### The planned analyses, visualizations, and coding challenges:

  * Analyses: Regressions of the following factors on two outcomes: 1) Eviction rates 

      + Median gross rent (in dataset) 

      + Rent burden (in dataset) 

      + Percent renter occupied (in dataset) 

      + % White (in dataset) 

      + Gentrification indices (external dataset) 

      + Dissimilarity indices (external and will require recoding) 

      + % of English-language speakers (external dataset) 

      + Change in population density (external dataset) 

  * Visualizations: 

      + Descriptives 

        * Line graph of eviction rates over time by neighborhood (assuming data available for enough years); if not enough data, then grouped bar chart of eviction rates 

        * Map of eviction rates by census tract over time (choropleth) 

        * Stacked bar chart (or line graph) of discrepancy between eviction filing rates and eviction rates, by neighborhood 

  * Analyses 

    + Dynamic maps of each predictor and eviction rate by neighborhood/census tract, over time 


### Planned Timeline


  * **November 7**: Confirm appropriate data sources 

    + Table of contents for deliverable website (pages, subpages, content) 

  * **November 11-15**: Have cleaned and merged dataset, initial descriptive plots, and website layout 

  * **November 30**: Visualizations complete  

  * **December 1**: Final write-up complete
