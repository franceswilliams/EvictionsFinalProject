### **Project Title:** Demographic and housing correlates of evictions in NYC, 2000-2016

### **Project Overview:**

**Group members:** Frances Williams (fw2334), Gloria Hu (gh2518), Naama
Kipperman (nk2814), Will Simmons (wes2121)

**Motivation for this project:** Evictions represent a major source of
housing instability. We are interested in census tract- and
neighborhood-level factors affecting the rates of eviction and eviction
filings in NYC.

metrics by census tracts, as well as interactive maps illustrating the
relationship between neighborhood-level variables and eviction rates.
