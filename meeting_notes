Run simple linear regressions, do cross-validation

Anticipated challenges
  - GIS and R integration
  - Missing data - making sure we fit our analyses to the data we have
      - Focusing more in-depth analyses on Brooklyn
  - Looks ambitious
  
Try to stay as close to proposal as possible... to pare down a bit:
  - Just look at four predictors on simple linear regressions, and do cross-validation on four
  
Add:
  - Potential challenges
  - Just 4 predictors
  - Cross-validation

To do:

  * Data
    - Merge and clean final dataset, with missing data investigated
    - Initial descriptive plots
    - Simple linear regression analyses (4)
    - Cross-validation of 4 linear regression analyses
    
  * Visualizations for website
    - Spaghetti plot of eviction rates over time by neighborhood (use neighborhood data conversion uploaded by Frances?)
    - Map of eviction rates by census tract over time (choropleth) 
    - Dynamic maps of each predictor and eviction rate by neighborhood/census tract, over time (Shiny app?)
    - (If time permits) Neighborhood-level evictions by gentrification indices
    - Interpretations/accompanying text for all visualizations 
    
  * Website
    - Table of contents for deliverable website (pages, subpages, content)
    - Empty pages for actual website built, with Git structure created (e.g. xxx.github.io site created)
    - Fill pages with text where needed
    - Fill pages with visualizations and interpretations where needed
