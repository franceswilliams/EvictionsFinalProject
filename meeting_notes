Run simple linear regressions, do cross-validation

Anticipated challenges
  - GIS and R integration
  - Missing data - making sure we fit our analyses to the data we have
      - Focusing more in-depth analyses on Brooklyn
  - Looks ambitious
  
Try to stay as close to proposal as possible... to pare down a bit:
  - Just look at four predictors on simple linear regressions, and do cross-validation on four
  
Add:
  - Potential challenges
  - Just 4 predictors
  - Cross-validation
